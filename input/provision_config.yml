# DO NOT REMOVE OR COMMENT OUT ANY LINES IN THIS FILE.
# SIMPLY APPEND THE REQUIRED VALUES AGAINST THE PARAMETER OF YOUR CHOICE.
# ***********************************************************************

#### Mandatory
# This Node name is used only for bmc dynamic discovered nodes
# Nodes present in mapping file, won't be considered for this node_name.
# Prefix for the node names, if needed to be dynamically allocated.
# Hostname = node_name + '0000x' + domain_name
# Hostname <= 65 characters.
# Example: servernode00001.Omnia.test , where node_name=servernode, domain_name=Omnia.test , 00001 used by Omnia
node_name: "node"

#### Mandatory
# Domain name the user intends to configure on the cluster.
# Please provide a valid domain name according to the domain name standards.
# Hostname = node_name + '0000x' + domain_name
# Hostname <= 65 characters.
# Example: servernode00001.Omnia.test ,where node_name=servernode ,domain_name=Omnia.test ,00001 used by Omnia
# Examples: abcd.test, ipa.test
domain_name: ""

#### Optional
# This depicts the path where user has kept the PXE mapping file.
# The mapping file consists of the Service tag, Admin MAC,Hostname and its respective admin IP address and/or BMC IP.
# Ensure that admin IPs given in mapping file are within the admin_static_ranges.
# A templates for mapping file exists in omnia/examples, namely, pxe_mapping_file.csv
# Format of csv: SERVICE_TAG,ADMIN_MAC,HOSTNAME,ADMIN_IP,BMC_IP
pxe_mapping_file_path: ""


#### Optional
# User defined disk partition applied to remote servers
# Unit: MB
# Accepted mount_point: /var, /tmp, /usr, swap
# Default partition size provided for RHEL/Rocky is /boot: 1024MB, /boot/efi: 256MB and remaining space to / partition.
# Default partition size provided for Ubuntu is /boot: 2148MB, /boot/efi: 1124MB and remaining space to / partition.
# Example for disk_partition:
# disk_partition:
#   - { mount_point: "/var", desired_capacity: "102400" }
disk_partition:
  - { mount_point: "", desired_capacity: "" }

#### Mandatory
# Timezone that needs to be set during OS provisioning.
# Available timezones are provided in discovery/roles/discovery_validations/common/files/timezone.txt
# Default: "GMT"
# Few accepted values: EST,CET,MST,CST6CDT,PST8PDT
timezone: "GMT"

#### Mandatory
# Language that needs to be set during OS provisioning.
# Default language supported is "en-US"
language: "en-US"

#### Mandatory
# Default lease time needs to be used by DHCP
# Unit: seconds
# Min: 21600
# Default: 86400
# Max: 31536000
default_lease_time: "86400"

#### Mandatory
# The ntp_support variable controls whether the cluster will have a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server configured in the Omnia Infrastructure Manager.
# If ntp_support is set to true, NTP server will be configured in the Omnia Infrastructure Manager and the time will be synchronized to the cluster nodes.
# If ntp_support is set to false, NTP server will not be configured in the Omnia Infrastructure Manager and the time will not be synchronized to the cluster nodes.
# In a proxy environment or environment with restricted network access, setting up NTP server in Omnia Infrastructure Manager can result in failure due to unreachable public NTP pools and is not recommended.
# Default: true
ntp_support: true
