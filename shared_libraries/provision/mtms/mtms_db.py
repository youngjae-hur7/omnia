def update_db():
    """
	Updates the database with node information.

	This function establishes a connection with the database and performs the following tasks:
	- Checks if the bmc_static_range is not empty.
	- If it is not empty, it extracts the serial and bmc information from the static_stanza_path.
	- It iterates over the serial and checks if the service tag exists in the cluster.nodeinfo table.
	- If the service tag does not exist, it generates a new node name and host name.
	- It updates the stanza file with the new serial and node.
	- It checks if the bmc_ip is already present in the cluster.nodeinfo table.
	- If the bmc_ip is not present, it calculates the admin_ip based on the bmc_ip and admin_subnet.
	- It checks if the admin_ip is within the admin_static_range.
	- If it is, it checks if the admin_ip is already present in the cluster.nodeinfo table.
	- If it is not present, it inserts the node information into the cluster.nodeinfo table.
	- If the admin_ip is not within the admin_static_range, it calculates the uncorrelated_admin_ip.
	- It inserts the node information into the cluster.nodeinfo table.
	- If the service tag already exists in the cluster.nodeinfo table, it prints a warning.

	Parameters:
	None

	Returns:
	None
